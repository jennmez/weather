## PROJECT BRIEF

For Mintbean's Hackathon event on 6/24, we were tasked to create a weather forecasting application using a public API database.

This project uses data pulled from OpenWeatherMaps current weather API.

## TO USE:

Visit https://jennmez.github.io/weather/, type the name of a city (no need for a state or country) into the search bar, and press enter. OpenMaps will search for the city's forecast in its database and the app will then display that information. Feel free to toggle with the temperature settings and view any additional information.
