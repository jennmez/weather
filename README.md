## PROJECT BRIEF

For Mintbean's Hackathon event on 6/24, we were tasked to create a weather forecasting application using a public API database.

This project uses data pulled from OpenWeatherMaps current weather API.

## TO USE

Visit https://jennmez.github.io/weather/, type the name of a city into the search bar and select. OpenWeatherMaps API will search for the location's forecast in its database, and once found, will display the current weather. Feel free to toggle with the temperature settings and view the upcoming 7-day forecast.
